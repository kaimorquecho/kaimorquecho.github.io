    "text": "Kaiju Morquecho Rubalcava graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies. During their undergraduate career, Kaiju studied food justice and land sovereignty, inspired by their grandparents’ land stewardship history and the food insecurity they experienced as an Indigenous Mexican immigrant. They served as the Co-Chair of UC Santa Barbara’s Environmental Justice Alliance, where they used the $35,000 budget to engage the UCSB community through workshops, speaker events, and sponsored scholarships for undocumented students interested in environmental justice. Under the supervision of UCSB’s food and farming professor and mentor Liz Carlisle, they created an artistic thesis about the direct relationship between colonialism, capitalism, and food injustice. They also worked as a restoration intern for the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration and as a summer research assistant to Bren PhD student Jason Maier, immersing themselves in Python without prior experience to analyze Food and Agriculture Organization data. After completing the MEDS program, Kaiju is committed to upholding the pillars of Indigenous data sovereignty and applying data science skills to solve problems that plague the food supply chain and perpetuate food and land injustice."

Explore Fire and Landsat Datasets\n\na. Landsat Data Exploration\n\n# Explore landsat data (see attributes, variables, and dimensions)\nlandsat\n\n\n# Check units of landsat data coordinates \nprint(f'x coordinates have unit: {landsat[\"x\"].attrs.get(\"units\")}')\nprint(f'y coordinates have unit: {landsat[\"y\"].attrs.get(\"units\")}')\n\n\n\nLandsat Data Exploration Summary\nI explored the Landsat NetCDF xaaray dataset (landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc), which contains multiple variables: spectral bands (red, green, blue, nir08, swir22) stored as 2D arrays with dimensions (1418,2742) collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. The dataset includes a time coordinate (containing just one value given that the data is from Feb 23, 2025) and a spatial_ref attribute. Both x and y coordinates are in metres, confirming that the data is projected in a UTM projected coordinate system.\n\n\nb. Fire Perimeter Data Exploration\nExplore the fire perimeter data.\n\n# Check Eaton fire perimeter data's CRS \nprint(eaton.crs)\n\n# Verify that Eaton fire perimeter data is on same CRS as the Palisades fire perimeter data\nassert(eaton.crs==palisades.crs) # Assert test confirms that they are on the same CRS system (EPSG 3857)\n\n\n# Check if Eaton and Palisades datasets are projected\nprint(f\"The Eaton fire perimeter dataset projected: {eaton.crs.is_projected}\")\nprint(f\"The Palisades fire perimeter dataset projected: {palisades.crs.is_projected}\")\n\n\n# Check Eaton dataset's columns and their data types\neaton.dtypes\n\n\n# Check Palisades dataset's columns and their data types\npalisades.dtypes\n\n\npalisades.plot()\neaton.plot()\n\n\n\nFire Perimeter Data Exploration Summary\nI explored the fire perimeter datasets for both the Eaton and Palisades fires, obtained from LACounty’s ArcGIS Hub. The datasets contain the dissolved fire perimeters, as of January 21, 2025, share the same coordinate reference system (EPSG 3857), and are projected. Each dataset contains columns for OBJECTID, type, Shape__Are, Shape__Len, and geometry. It is interesting and alarming to see how extensive the fires (and therefore, their perimeters) were, especially given that they gained so much territory within 24 hours.\n\n\n\n3. Restore Landsat Geospatial Information\n\n# Check dataset's CRS\nprint(landsat.rio.crs)\n\nWhile we cannot access a CRS in Landsat, that does not mean the dataset is not a geospatial object. Access the spatial_ref.crs_wkt attribute of the dataset and print the CRS.\n\n# Access and extract spatial_ref.crs_wkt attribute and store in variable\nlandsat_crs = landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt\n\ntype(landsat_crs) # Check that it is an acceptable object for next step\n\n\n# Use rio.write_crs() to recover the geospatial information \nlandsat.rio.write_crs(landsat_crs, inplace=True)\n\n\n# Check that dataset has been updated with the CRS\nprint(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n\n\n4. Plot a True Color Image Using Landsat Data\n\nlandsat[['red','green','blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\n\n\na. The true color image looks blank due to the RGB values of the clouds. Their values are outliers that are causing the other RGB values to be squished when plotting. To fix this, adjust the robust paramater of the imshow() method.\n\nlandsat[['red','green','blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\nb. To resolve the RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast xx = (xx * 255).astype(np.uint8) warning, identify the bands with nan values, which .plot.imshow() sees as invalid.\n\n# use isnan() and .sum() to find the sum of nans in each band in landsat dataset\nnan_mask = np.isnan(landsat[['red','green','blue']].to_array()).sum(dim=['y','x'])\n\n\n# Print the results by band\nfor band, count in zip(nan_mask['variable'].values, nan_mask.values):\n    print(f'{band} band has {count} nans')\n\n\n\nc. Use fillna() to replace nans with zeros and plot again\n\nlandsat[['red','green','blue']].fillna(value=0).to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\n\n\n\nInitial and final true color image comparison:\nInitial attempt to plot the true color image raised two warnings and produced a white image. The first warning was due to extreme values (likely clouds) in the landsat data. These values were extreme RGB outliersn that squished other RGB values. The second warning was due to np.nan values, which were invalid values for xarray. The first warning was resolved by adjusting the robust paramater of the imshow() method, and the second by replacing the np.nan values with zeros. After this, the true color image was accurate and without warnings.\n\n\n\n5. False Color Image\n\n# Plot a false color image using landsat data variables 'swir22','nir08', and 'red' (short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and red band)\nlandsat[['swir22','nir08','red']].fillna(value=0).to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\n\n\n\n6.

These were assigned to the red channel, green channel, and blue channel, in that order. On top of the image I plotted the perimeters of the Eaton and Palisades burn areas (color orange) with the color ‘darkorchid’ to clearly outline their location."
